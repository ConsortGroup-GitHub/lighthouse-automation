To identify plugins that are adding extraneous CSS, try running [code coverage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/coverage/) in Chrome DevTools. You can identify the theme/plugin responsible from the URL of the stylesheet. Look out for plugins that have many stylesheets in the list which have a lot of red in code coverage. A plugin should only enqueue a stylesheet if it is actually used on the page.",

Also consider using [the AMP plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/).",

Beware that optimizations provided by these plugins may break features of your theme or plugins, so you will likely need to make code changes.",
